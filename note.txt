These lines are hints for debugging (where the code following the line actually came from)

#hack
If you want see what is included in a system header file, just include the header file, then
gcc -o /tmp/tmp.i -E -P /tmp.c
-E option tell gcc to stop after prepression

# line-number "source-file" [flags]
Meaning of flags (space separated):

1 - Start of a new file
2 - Returning to previous file
3 - Following text comes from a system header file (#include <> vs #include "")
4 - Following text should be treated as being wrapped in an implicit extern "C" block.

   Evaluation of the macro call begins like evaluation of a function
call except for one crucial difference: the macro arguments are the
actual expressions appearing in the macro call.  They are not evaluated
before they are given to the macro definition.  By contrast, the
arguments of a function are results of evaluating the elements of the
function call list.
